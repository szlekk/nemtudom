# Application Class Documentation

This is a PHP class named `Application` that is responsible for initializing the application and configuring its settings.

## Class Methods

### __construct()

This is the constructor function of the class. It initializes the Application class by setting error reporting level and unregistering globals.

### _set_reporting()

This private function sets the error reporting level based on the application's debug mode. If debug mode is enabled, all errors will be displayed. If debug mode is disabled, errors will be logged but not displayed.

### _unregister_globals()

This private function unregisters global variables to enhance security. If `register_globals` is enabled, it can lead to security vulnerabilities. This method unsets global variables to prevent direct access to them.

This markdown documentation provides an overview of the PHP `Application` class and describes the functionality of each method in the class. Note that the private methods `_set_reporting()` and `_unregister_globals()` are intended to be used internally by the class and are not directly accessible.
